    Ruhnau \& Schiele (2023), \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2023.113763}{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2023.113763}
    
    \enquote{In many net-zero energy scenarios, electrolytic hydrogen is a key component to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and to provide flexibility to the power sector. In current energy systems that are not yet fully decarbonized, however, the hydrogen ramp-up raises the concern of increasing power sector emissions. To avoid such additional emissions, recent EU regulation defines requirements for electrolytic hydrogen to qualify as green along three dimensions: the additionality, the proximity, and the simultaneity of renewable electricity generation. Focusing on the temporal dimension, this article investigates the effects of a strict hourly simultaneity requirement, full temporal flexibility, as well as simultaneity exemptions in the current EU regulation. [..] We argue that current energy transition trends further lower the risk of increasing power sector emissions under a flexible definition of green hydrogen and recommend this as the way forward for a sustainable hydrogen policy.}

    \enquote{Accurate modelling of the weather's temporal and spatial impacts on building energy demand is critical to decarbonizing energy systems. Here we introduce a customizable model for hourly heating and cooling demand applicable globally at all spatial scales. We validate against demand from ~5,000 buildings and 43 regions across four continents. The model requires limited data inputs and shows better agreement with measured demand than existing models. We use it first to demonstrate that a 1\degree\hspace{0pt}C reduction in thermostat settings across all buildings could reduce Europe's gas consumption by 240~TWh~yr$^{-1}$, approximately one-sixth of historical imports from Russia. Second, we show that service demand for cooling is increasing by up to 5\% per year in some regions due to climate change, and 5 billion people experience >100 additional cooling degree days per year when compared with a generation ago. The model and underlying data are freely accessible to promote further research.}

    \enquote{Variable, low-cost, low-carbon electricity that would otherwise be curtailed may provide a substantial economic opportunity for entities that can flexibly adapt their electricity consumption. We used historical hourly weather data over the contiguous U.S. to model the characteristics of least-cost electricity systems dominated by variable renewable generation that powered firm and flexible electricity demands (loads). [..] The macro-scale energy model indicated that variable renewable electricity systems optimized to supply firm loads at current costs could supply 25\% or more additional flexible load with minimal capacity expansion, while resulting in reduced average electricity costs (10\% or less capacity expansion and 10\% to 20\% reduction in costs in our modeled scenarios). These results indicate that adding flexible loads to electricity systems will likely allow more full utilization of generation assets across a wide range of system architectures, thus providing new energy services with infrastructure that is already needed to supply firm electricity loads.}

    \enquote{The mitigation scenarios database of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Report is an important resource for informing policymaking on energy transitions. However, there is a large variety of models, scenario designs, and resulting outputs. Here we analyse the scenarios consistent with limiting warming to 2\degree\hspace{0pt}C or below regarding the speed, trajectory, and feasibility of different fossil fuel reduction pathways. In scenarios limiting warming to 1.5\degree\hspace{0pt}C with no or limited overshoot, global coal, oil, and natural gas supply (intended for all uses) decline on average by 95\%, 62\%, and 42\%, respectively, from 2020 to 2050, but the long-term role of gas is highly variable. Higher-gas pathways are enabled by higher carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR), but are likely associated with inadequate model representation of regional CO$_2$ storage capacity and technology adoption, diffusion, and path-dependencies. If CDR is constrained by limits derived from expert consensus, the respective modelled coal, oil, and gas reductions become 99\%, 70\%, and 84\%. Our findings suggest the need to adopt unambiguous near- and long-term reduction benchmarks in coal, oil, and gas production and use alongside other climate mitigation targets.}

    Oshiro \& Fujimori (2022), \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118803}{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118803}
    
    \enquote{Hydrogen-based energy carriers, including hydrogen, ammonia and synthetic hydrocarbons, are expected to help reduce residual carbon dioxide emissions in the context of the Paris Agreement goals, although their potential has not yet been fully clarified in light of their competitiveness and complementarity with other mitigation options such as electricity, biofuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS). This study aimed to explore the role of hydrogen in the global energy system under various mitigation scenarios and technology portfolios using a detailed energy system model that considers various energy technologies including the conversion and use of hydrogen-based energy carriers. The results indicate that the share of hydrogen-based energy carriers generally remains less than 5\% of global final energy demand by 2050 in the 2\degree\hspace{0pt}C scenarios. Nevertheless, such carriers contribute to removal of residual emissions from the industry and transport sectors under specific conditions. Their share increases to 10-15\% under stringent mitigation scenarios corresponding to 1.5\degree\hspace{0pt}C warming and scenarios without CCS. The transport sector is the largest consumer, accounting for half or more of hydrogen production, followed by the industry and power sectors. [..]}

    \enquote{[..] We have modeled optimized, deeply decarbonized power systems in three US regions at mid-century under a wide range of plausible cost and technology assumptions. The shadow marginal values of energy (MVEs) from these optimizations approximate the wholesale spot prices of energy in simplified hypothetical competitive energy-only wholesale markets in which revenues earned by selling energy in wholesale electricity markets should be sufficient to cover all capital and operating costs. A very robust result is that under carbon constraints, very low MVEs occur much more frequently than in today's wholesale markets, and very high prices are also more frequent than today. Revenues from a relatively small number of high MVE periods are required to fully cover VRE capital and operating costs, while storage charges and discharges in many hours. In an ideal, efficient regime, a competitive energy-only wholesale market without price caps would minimize total system costs, and retail rates equal to wholesale spot prices would fully cover those costs and induce efficient demand behavior. Real power systems depart significantly from this ideal: price caps are used frequently in wholesale markets, capacity payments from organized capacity markets or bilateral contracts are relied on to supplement energy market revenues to enable full cost recovery, [..]}

    Gøtske et al. (2023), \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXEnergy.2.023006}{https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXEnergy.2.023006}
    
    \enquote{Future highly renewable energy systems might require substantial storage deployment. At the current stage, the technology portfolio of dominant storage options is limited to pumped-hydro storage and Li-ion batteries. It is uncertain which storage design will be able to compete with these options. Considering Europe as a case study, we derive the cost and efficiency requirements of a generic storage technology, which we refer to as \emph{storage-X}, to be deployed in the cost-optimal system. [..] Based on a sample space of 724 storage configurations, we show that energy capacity cost and discharge efficiency largely determine the optimal storage deployment, in agreement with previous studies. Here, we show that charge capacity cost is also important due to its impact on renewable curtailment. A significant deployment of storage-X in a cost-optimal system requires (a) discharge efficiency of at least 95\%, (b) discharge efficiency of at least 50\% together with low energy capacity cost (10~€/kWh), or (c) discharge efficiency of at least 25\% with very low energy capacity cost (2~€/kWh). Comparing our findings with seven emerging technologies reveals that none of them fulfill these requirements.  [..]}

    \enquote{Here, an integrative approach is proposed to link integrated assessment modelling results from the GCAM model with a novel portfolio analysis framework. This framework comprises a bi-objective optimisation model, Monte Carlo analysis and the Iterative Trichotomic Approach, aimed at carrying out stochastic uncertainty assessment and enhancing robustness. The approach is applied for identifying optimal technological portfolios for power generation in the EU towards climate change mitigation until 2050. The considered technologies include photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, wind, nuclear, biomass and carbon capture and storage, for which different subsidy curves for emissions reduction and energy security are considered.}

    Kätelhön et al. (2019), \href{https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821029116}{https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821029116}
    
    \enquote{Chemical production is set to become the single largest driver of global oil consumption by 2030. To reduce oil consumption and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon dioxide can be captured from stacks or air and utilized as alternative carbon source for chemicals. Here, we show that carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has the technical potential to decouple chemical production from fossil resources, reducing annual GHG emissions by up to 3.5 Gt CO$_2$-eq in 2030. Exploiting this potential, however, requires more than 18.1 PWh of low-carbon electricity, corresponding to 55\% of the projected global electricity production in 2030. Most large-scale CCU technologies are found to be less efficient in reducing GHG emissions per unit low-carbon electricity when benchmarked to power-to-X efficiencies reported for other large-scale applications including electro-mobility (e-mobility) and heat pumps. Once and where these other demands are satisfied, CCU in the chemical industry could efficiently contribute to climate change mitigation.}

    \enquote{Net anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) must approach zero by mid-century (2050) in order to stabilize the global mean temperature at the level targeted by international efforts. Yet continued expansion of fossil-fuel-burning energy infrastructure implies already ‘committed’ future CO$_2$ emissions. Here we use detailed datasets of existing fossil-fuel energy infrastructure in 2018 to estimate regional and sectoral patterns of committed CO$_2$ emissions, the sensitivity of such emissions to assumed operating lifetimes and schedules, and the economic value of the associated infrastructure. [...] Our estimates suggest that little or no new CO$_2$-emitting infrastructure can be commissioned, and that existing infrastructure may need to be retired early (or be retrofitted with carbon capture and storage technology) in order to meet the Paris Agreement climate goals. Given the asset value per tonne of committed emissions, we suggest that the most cost-effective premature infrastructure retirements will be in the electricity and industry sectors, if non-emitting alternatives are available and affordable.}

    \enquote{Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be essential to meet the climate targets, so enabling its deployment at the right time will be decisive. Here, we investigate the still poorly understood implications of delaying CDR actions, focusing on integrating direct air capture and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (DACCS and BECCS) into the European Union power mix. Under an indicative target of 50 Gt of net CO$_2$ by 2100, delayed CDR would cost an extra of 0.12-0.19 trillion EUR per year of inaction. Moreover, postponing CDR beyond mid-century would substantially reduce the removal potential to almost half (35.60 Gt CO$_2$) due to the underused biomass and land resources and the maximum technology diffusion speed. The effective design of BECCS and DACCS systems calls for long-term planning starting from now and aligned with the evolving power systems. Our quantitative analysis of the consequences of inaction on CDR--with climate targets at risk and fair CDR contributions at stake—should help to break the current impasse and incentivize early actions worldwide.}
